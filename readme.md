lang Web Server
----
This GoLang web server can be used to get familiar with GO in general or if you need a test application for learning to deploy on cloud infrastructure and/or kubernetes. 


### Prerequisites 

-----

[Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.11+

## Start the server

Once Go is installed, you can simply clone the project and test out the server on your machine. To start server, change into the directory with the file `server.go` and type:

```sh
$ go run server.go
```

## Code breakdown

```sh
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "html"
        "log"
        "net/http"
        "time"
)

func main() {

        fmt.Println("It works")
        http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
                now := time.Now()
                fmt.Println("Incoming request from " + r.RemoteAddr + " at ")
                fmt.Println(now)
                fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %q", html.EscapeString(r.URL.Path))
        })

        http.HandleFunc("/golang", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
                fmt.Fprintf(w, "Happy Gopher")
        })

        log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8081", nil))

}
```

Our first HandleFunc function waits for incoming requests to the path "/" and tells our server the IP address of the incoming client and the time the request came in. It also sends a response back to the client with the text `Hello` and any string after the "/". For example, if the client typed `curl http://localhost:8081/bob` they would get a response of "Hello bob".

Our second HandleFunc function simply responds to any incoming requests to `http://localhost:8081/golang` with "Happy Gopher."
